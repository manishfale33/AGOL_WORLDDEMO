							<h6>What do we do? </h6>
							<p>An increase in the rapidity of the contraction of the globe leading to the convenience of
								accessibility of everything around the world is challenging the possibility for
								countries to import goods from every nuke and corner and make it available at an ease.
							</p>
							<p>And <b>IMPORTER OF RECORD service</b> is just the perfect answer to all the complicated
								import-related concerns. The International rules and regulations for global businesses
								are gruesome and there is a dire need to tackle all of them while you start any business
								aiming at global audiences and we come in handy to get your process run smoothly. </p>

								aiming at global audiences and we come in handy to get your process run smoothly. </p>
							<h6>Customer Benefits:</h6>
							<p>The hike in the expectations of the markets has made the competition very crucial. Even
								the survival of the businesses is at risk, so everyone wants to provide the most
								authentic and reliable product or service which most of the time includes importing
								materials from different countries. Now while it may seem easy if you have any physical
								presence in the country, but if not then the laws that guard importing related processes
								are very strict. </p>

								authentic and reliable product or service which most of the time includes importing
								materials from different countries. Now while it may seem easy if you have any physical
								presence in the country, but if not then the laws that guard importing related processes
								are very strict. </p>
							<h2>What is Importer of Record?</h2>
							<p>Importer of record simply refers to a third party that is responsible for the importing
								of the goods. Right from the convenience to sticking by the governmental rules and
								regulations. They can also get involved in various other factors that linger around the
								processes and provide complete aid to those businesses that require importing of goods.
							</p>
							<h6>Compliance Concerns For the Importer of Record: </h6>
							<p>Any business that merges with the third party Importer of record service in seek of
								getting aid, the IMPORTER OF RECORD is then compelled to be responsible for having
								everything checked from their end. They need to have records of the rules and
								regulations of both the countries to make sure that they are not breaking any law of
								either of the countries, self-auditing must be carried out, the management and other
								programs should be monitored. Any loopholes in the process can cause the IMPORTER OF
								RECORD service provider to face heavy penalties, so the IMPORTER OF RECORD service
								provider is complied to stick by the rules well. </p>
							<h6>Documentation Responsibilities:</h6>
							<p>The importer of records has a major role to play when it comes to documentation and
								related compliances. They need to adhere to the strict rules that help them to dodge any
								risks that come their way, following are the requirements of documentation to carry out
								the process free of hurdles. </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Broad classification of the goods to be imported is very important to be able to
									understand and assess them.</li>
								<li>All the fees including the tax, tariffs, and all other are evaluated by them.</li>
								<li>Playing by the rules and regulations to carry out a hassle-free process keeping the
									convenience of the customers in mind. </li>
								<li>If any specific declarations when required need to be filed. </li>
								<li>If any specific declarations when required need to be filed. </li>
								<li>Also includes inspection of the goods and businesses associated with them. </li>
								<li>Making sure that the documentation is on point, to meet the requirements of Custom.
								</li>
								<li>And most importantly taking complete responsibility and accountability for the goods
									at the time of import. </li>
							</ul>
							<h6>And most importantly taking complete responsibility and accountability for the goods at
								the time of import. </h6>
							<p>We are all aware of the importance of international trade. While the ease of access to
								commodities around the world is getting better with the introduction of technology, some
								processes do not rely on just these aspects and still are subjected to a lot of
								restrictions to maintain the security of the countries. So one such matter is the import
								industry. </p>
							<p>While the Global Supply Chain relies on the effectiveness of the importing process, still
								the said has to undergo many layers so that the management occurs with the compliance of
								the rules. Import of Records is directly proportional to the productivity of the Global
								Supply Chain Management due to its major role in importing goods at convenience.</p>

								Supply Chain Management due to its major role in importing goods at convenience.</p>
							<h6>Creation of the Importer of Record:</h6>
							<p>The creation of the Importer of Record happened a few years back, in the year 1993. Due
								to the shipments of large amounts of international trade, it became a necessity to have
								some third party monitor and take the assurity of the goods that are being transported
								to avoid risks and maintain security. IMPORTER OF RECORD service provider is responsible
								for the compliance with the federal laws in the different countries they provide
								services to. </p>
							<p>The roles of the IMPORTER OF RECORD and the rules they need to abide by were created by
								CBP (Custom and Border Protection) to ensure the authenticity of the goods transported
								and to be aware of the activities that take place to make sure that the goods are
								imported for genuine business purposes and not for any destructive reasons. </p>
							<h6>Appointing the Importer of Record: </h6>
							<p>While importing goods for business purposes with a Global perspective becomes mandatory,
								the confusions that occur are bizarre. It's not as simple as it seems, the importing of
								goods, investments involved, and the security of the same until it reaches the end-user
								is much more complicated than looks. </p>

							<h3>Requirements for Importer of Record: </h3>
							<p>Accessibility to IMPORTER OF RECORD services has become easier with the passing of time.
								We at AGOL worldwide provide complete access to all the import-related services that can
								be very much useful and comes in handy when there is involvement in the importing of the
								goods. The in and out requirements needed will be looked after by us. Right from the
								required documents to handling the transportation abiding by the rules and regulations
								and paying all the taxes and fees properly is what we keenly look after. </p>
